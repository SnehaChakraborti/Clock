Project Title: Digital Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Project Description:
The Digital Clock project aims to create a visually appealing and functional clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will provide a digital representation of the current time, including hours, minutes, and seconds, in a format similar to a traditional digital clock.

The project will consist of three main components:

1. HTML Structure:
   The HTML structure will define the layout and elements required for the digital clock. It will include a container to hold the clock display and other necessary elements, such as labels for hours, minutes, and seconds.

2. CSS Styling:
   CSS will be used to enhance the visual appearance of the clock. Styling elements such as fonts, colors, sizes, and backgrounds will be applied to create an attractive design. Additionally, CSS animations or transitions can be used to add smooth effects to the clock's behavior.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   JavaScript will provide the dynamic functionality to the clock. It will retrieve the current time from the user's device and update the clock display accordingly. The JavaScript code will use built-in Date functions to continuously update the hours, minutes, and seconds. It will also handle any necessary formatting, such as adding leading zeros to single-digit values.

Key Features:
- Real-time display of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Automatic updating of the clock display without requiring page refresh.
- Responsive design to ensure the clock adapts to different screen sizes.
- Attractive visual styling using CSS.
- Smooth animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.

Expected Deliverables:
- HTML file with the structure of the clock.
- CSS file with the styles and visual enhancements for the clock.
- JavaScript file containing the necessary code for retrieving and updating the time.
- Additional assets (such as images or icons) if required.
- Documentation explaining how to use the clock and any specific instructions for customization.

Optional Enhancements:
- Customizable color themes or backgrounds.
- Support for displaying the date alongside the time.
- Alarm feature to set a specific time for an alert or notification.

By completing this project, users will have a functional and visually appealing digital clock that they can incorporate into their websites or web applications, providing an interactive and informative time display.
